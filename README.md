## A minimal micropython + cmake example
I can't find any tutorials to tell me how to build micropython with cmake, so I created one, hope it helps.
1. clone the repository with `git clone xxx --recursive`
2. create and goto `build` folder with `mkdir build && cd build`
3. build the project with `cmake .. && make`
4. run the binary with `./micropython`
